# Timeout and Freeze Detection Fixes Summary

## Problem Analysis

Based on the error log from `DummyError.txt`, the application was experiencing a **timeout/cancellation cascade** that caused:

1. **UI Freeze Detection** triggered after 32+ seconds during HTTP API call
2. **Task Cancellation Cascade** - freeze detection cancelled operations â†’ HTTP calls failed â†’ document save failed â†’ backup restoration failed
3. **Successful operations reported as failures** due to post-save cancellation token checks

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **HTTP Timeout vs Freeze Detection Race Condition**

- `HttpClient.Timeout = 5 minutes` (too long)
- `Freeze detection = 30 seconds` (too aggressive)
- **Result**: Freeze detection cancelled operations before HTTP timeout occurred

### 2. **No API-Specific Timeout Protection**

- `CallRealApiAsync()` relied only on HttpClient global timeout
- Most methods had no timeout protection
- **Result**: API calls could hang indefinitely until freeze detection intervened

### 3. **Post-Save Cancellation Issues**

- Document saved successfully but 50ms delay threw `TaskCanceledException`
- Backup restoration used cancellable tokens during error recovery
- **Result**: Successful operations reported as failures

## Fixes Implemented

### ðŸ”§ **1. HTTP Timeout Configuration**

**File**: `BulkEditor.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

```csharp
// OLD: 5 minute timeout
client.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);

// NEW: 60 second timeout to prevent UI freezing
client.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);
```

### ðŸ”§ **2. API Call Timeout Protection**

**File**: `BulkEditor.Infrastructure/Services/HyperlinkReplacementService.cs`

#### Real API Calls:

```csharp
// Added 45-second timeout protection
using var timeoutCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken);
timeoutCts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45));
var response = await _httpService.PostJsonAsync(apiEndpoint, requestBody, timeoutCts.Token);
```

#### Simulation Calls:

```csharp
// Added 30-second timeout for simulation
using var timeoutCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken);
timeoutCts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
await Task.Delay(100, timeoutCts.Token);
```

### ðŸ”§ **3. Freeze Detection Improvements**

**File**: `BulkEditor.UI/ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs`

#### Timer Frequency:

```csharp
// OLD: Check every 5 seconds
_freezeDetectionTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(5000);

// NEW: Check every 10 seconds (less aggressive)
_freezeDetectionTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(10000);
```

#### Detection Thresholds:

```csharp
// OLD: 30 seconds trigger, immediate cancellation
if (timeSinceLastUpdate.TotalSeconds > 30)

// NEW: 90 seconds warning, 120 seconds intervention
if (timeSinceLastUpdate.TotalSeconds > 90)
{
    // Only cancel after 2+ minutes of severe freeze
    if (timeSinceLastUpdate.TotalSeconds > 120 && IsProcessing)
```

#### User Notification:

```csharp
// Added user notification for recovery attempts
_notificationService.ShowWarning("Processing Recovery",
    "The application detected an unresponsive operation and attempted automatic recovery.");
```

### ðŸ”§ **4. Document Processing Timeout Coordination**

**File**: `BulkEditor.Infrastructure/Services/DocumentProcessor.cs`

#### API Processing:

```csharp
// OLD: 2-minute timeout
timeoutCts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2));

// NEW: 75-second timeout (HTTP 60s + buffer)
timeoutCts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(75));
```

#### Post-Save Operations:

```csharp
// OLD: Cancellable delay that could fail successful saves
await Task.Delay(50, cancellationToken);

// NEW: Non-cancellable delay (document already saved)
await Task.Delay(50, CancellationToken.None);
```

### ðŸ”§ **5. Error Recovery Improvements**

#### Backup Restoration:

```csharp
// OLD: Used external cancellation token
await RestoreFromBackupAsync(document.FilePath, document.BackupPath, cancellationToken);

// NEW: Non-cancellable recovery
await RestoreFromBackupAsync(document.FilePath, document.BackupPath, CancellationToken.None);
```

#### Backup Method Enhancement:

```csharp
// Added timeout protection with fallback logic
using var timeoutCts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
await _fileService.CopyFileAsync(backupPath, filePath, timeoutCts.Token);

// Final attempt with timeout but no external cancellation
if (cancelled) {
    using var finalTimeoutCts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15));
    await _fileService.CopyFileAsync(backupPath, filePath, finalTimeoutCts.Token);
}
```

## Timeout Hierarchy

The fixes establish a coordinated timeout hierarchy:

```
1. HTTP Client Global: 60 seconds
2. API Call Specific: 45 seconds
3. Document Processing: 75 seconds (60s + buffer)
4. Freeze Detection Warning: 90 seconds
5. Freeze Detection Intervention: 120 seconds
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### âœ… **Normal Operation**

- API calls complete within 45 seconds
- No freeze detection warnings
- Document processing completes successfully

### âœ… **Slow API Response (45-60s)**

- API call times out gracefully
- Falls back to simulation mode
- Processing continues without UI freeze

### âœ… **Very Slow Network (60-90s)**

- HTTP client times out
- Error handling engages
- User sees network error message
- No false freeze detection

### âœ… **Actual UI Freeze (90+ seconds)**

- Warning logged at 90 seconds
- User notification at 120 seconds
- Graceful recovery attempt
- Preserve completed work

## Files Modified

1. **`BulkEditor.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`**

   - Reduced HTTP client timeout from 5 minutes to 60 seconds

2. **`BulkEditor.Infrastructure/Services/HyperlinkReplacementService.cs`**

   - Added 45-second timeout to `CallRealApiAsync()`
   - Added 30-second timeout to `SimulateApiCallAsync()`

3. **`BulkEditor.UI/ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs`**

   - Increased freeze detection timer from 5s to 10s intervals
   - Increased freeze warning threshold from 30s to 90s
   - Increased freeze intervention threshold to 120s
   - Added user notification for recovery attempts

4. **`BulkEditor.Infrastructure/Services/DocumentProcessor.cs`**
   - Reduced API processing timeout from 2 minutes to 75 seconds
   - Made post-save delay non-cancellable
   - Enhanced backup restoration with timeout protection
   - Made recovery operations non-cancellable

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Normal Processing**: Verify typical documents process without issues
2. **Slow Network**: Test with network delays to ensure graceful fallback
3. **Timeout Scenarios**: Test API timeouts trigger simulation mode correctly
4. **Recovery Testing**: Verify backup restoration works when errors occur
5. **UI Responsiveness**: Confirm UI remains responsive during processing

## Benefits

- âœ… **Prevents False Failures**: Successful saves no longer reported as failures
- âœ… **Coordinated Timeouts**: All timeouts work together instead of competing
- âœ… **Graceful Degradation**: Network issues fall back to simulation mode
- âœ… **Data Protection**: Recovery operations complete even during cancellation
- âœ… **User Experience**: Clear notifications about recovery attempts
- âœ… **Reduced Support Issues**: Fewer reports of "processing failed" when it actually succeeded
